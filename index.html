Ʒerʒcoin is a government scandal!
Ʒerʒcoin (pronounced Zherzh) was aparently created as a joke by the user IzzayaB52 To suposedly "make fun of crypto". But why would someone create a crypto to make fun of crypto? Thats because Ʒerʒcoin is actually a government owned pyramid scheme and rug pull! :o I mean just look ad these ads, they do be lookin awfully suspicous. Please take this as a peice of advice and sell your Ʒerʒcoin before its too late! (this message is not endorsed by the government, note family tree, or crobodile games inc.)
